VOTE SYSTEM 

The Mini Voting System is a user-friendly C program designed to manage and conduct elections or
 polls.
 
 We have created functions for each feature, organize the code into a menu-driven structure 
 and developed algorithms for vote counting and option management.


We have designed a program that allows users to vote for options presented to them.

We have also used data structures (arrays
 or linked lists) to store candidate info, options, and vote counts.
  Functions to manage candidate details, votes, and option updates have been developed.

 A loop to continuously display updated vote counts and allow new votes has been implemented.




 The functionality of the Online voting system is mentioned below:

 1)Taking input from the user

 2)Storing vote

 3)Calculating votes

 4)Declaring results
